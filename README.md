# git-starter-rust

It is a incomplete simple git implementation in rust for learning purposes.

# Testing locally

The `cargo run` command is expected to operate on the `.git` folder inside the
current working directory. If you're running this inside the root of this
repository, you might end up accidentally damaging repository's `.git`
folder.

It is suggested to execute binary in a different folder when testing locally.
